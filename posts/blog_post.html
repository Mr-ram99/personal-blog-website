                Greetings, developers! Have you ever had a case of coder's block" where you need a little help or
                inspiration to write code? Or need some help understanding code that you inherited from someone else?
                Well, you're in luck! From generating boilerplate code to debugging or explaining existing code, ChatGPT
                is a no-brainer way to be a faster, more efficient software engineer. OpenAI's ChatGPT falls into the
                category of <u>generative AI</u>, which is a type of artificial intelligence that generates new or novel
                content based on data it's been trained on. That means ChatGPT can not only write essays, jokes and
                poems for you; it can also be your pair programmer. So let's dive in and see how you can use it to work
                smarter, not harder.

                <h2>Should you code with ChatGPT?</h2>
                Just because you can write code with ChatGPT, does that mean you should?  There are a variety of opinions on this.  On one side, people argue that using an AI tool to write code makes you lazy and unable to think for yourself.  On the other side, folks say that leveraging ChatGPT can make you a faster programmer, freeing up your time to focus on the more important things like architecture, best practices and business requirements.I can see both sides of the argument.  Let's take a look at some pros and cons.
                <h3><u>The pros</u></h3>
                It's quick and easy to generate code using ChatGPT.  If you were going to StackOverflow or Google to find a code snippet anyway, why not shorten the amount of time it takes to find it? ChatGPT generally gets syntax right, potentially saving you time chasing compile-time or runtime errors that we humans can introduce if we're coding from scratch.
                By using ChatGPT for coding, you might get introduced to some alternative ways of doing things that you wouldn't have thought about otherwise.ChatGPT makes it faster and easier to learn new languages and concepts, with explanations and code all in the same interface.
                <h3><u>The cons</u></h3>
                While artificial intelligence has come a long way, and ChatGPT is quite frankly mind-blowing, it's not 100% correct all the time.  It makes mistakes just like us.  And sometimes it's really confident when it makes those mistakes.  So you still need to check it, test it and debug it-just like you've done in the past. ChatGPT lacks the overall context for what you're building and why.  Sure, it can give you a code snippet, or even an entire code file.  But it won't understand conventions or best practices for your company or project.  It doesn't know how that code will interact with other code.  It doesn't understand requirements around performance, security, privacy, accessibility and so on.  Again, as a human, you're ultimately responsible for the code that ships.

                </p>
                <h2>How does ChatGPT help to grow your coding skills?</h2>
                When you need to learn a new programming language or feature, what do you do today?  You might search for tutorials, watch courses, try writing and running code to see what it does.  This likely involves jumping around to several different resources, which can be time-consuming.  And how many times do you encounter errors trying to run code you found online?  For me, it's almost always!ChatGPT can reduce the amount of time it takes to do all of this.  It effectively aggregates information from the many sources it was trained on, and presents them to you in a single interface.  It also explains what the code does, and sometimes even gives you alternative ways of doing things.  It's like having a real-time tutor with you as you're writing and reading the code.
                Another huge bonus of learning through ChatGPT is the fact that it uses natural language processing for input and output.  Meaning, just ask questions in plain English, as if you were asking a mentor or a friend.  You don't have to know exact technical terms or syntax to ask the question.
                You can also refine and build out your conversation over time.  If you didn't quite “get” a concept that it explained, you can ask something like, “Can you explain that in a simpler way?”  Or, “Can you explain that for a 5-year-old?”  Being able to tailor responses to your current level of understanding is a pretty remarkable benefit.
